## Requirement

Vitest testing framework setup with configuration file, test directory structure, and a sample passing test to verify the setup works.
### Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-config**: Vitest configuration file exists at vitest.config.ts
- **AC-test-dir**: Test directory (tests/) must exist and be configured
- **AC-sample-test**: A sample test file exists in tests/setup.test.ts
- **AC-passing-test**: **When tests run, the sample test must pass**
- **AC-sample-test-content**: Test verifies that the is a placeholder that demonstrates basic functionality
- **AC-coverage**: Test coverage reporting enabled
- **AC-watch-mode**: Watch mode configured for development
- **AC-globals**: Global test setup/teardown configured if needed
- **AC-matchers**: Default matchers configured for inline snapshots assertions
- **AC-timeout**: Test timeout configured (5 seconds by default)
- **AC-isolation**: Isolation enabled for each test file by default
- **AC-reset-vm**: Pool automatically reset modules between test runs
- **AC-mock**: Mocking capabilities configured with sensible defaults

### Out of scope

- File watching and test output
- **Performance**: Keep tests fast (aim for <100ms per test)
- **Coverage**: Start simple (80% target)
