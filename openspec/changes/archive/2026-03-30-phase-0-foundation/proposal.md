## Why

The OpenForge Pipeline project needs a solid foundation before any implementation can begin. Without proper project setup, TypeScript configuration, testing infrastructure, directory structure, linting/formatting, and template files, subsequent phases cannot proceed. This foundation ensures code quality, maintainability, and enables parallel development by multiple subagents.

## What Changes

- Initialize Node.js 20+ project with `package.json` containing TypeScript, Vitest, Zod, and commander dependencies
- Configure TypeScript with strict mode and Node 20+ target in `tsconfig.json`
- Set up Vitest testing framework with `vitest.config.ts` and a sample passing test
- Create complete `src/` directory structure per ROADMAP.md Package Structure section
- Add ESLint and Prettier configuration for code quality enforcement
- Create template files for ROADMAP, HANDOFF, and forge config

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `project-initialization`: Node.js project setup with package.json, including all required dependencies (TypeScript, Vitest, Zod, commander) and npm scripts for build, test, and lint operations
- `typescript-configuration`: TypeScript compiler configuration with strict mode enabled, Node 18+ target, proper module resolution, and output directory configuration
- `testing-infrastructure`: Vitest testing framework setup with configuration file, test directory structure, and a sample passing test to verify the setup works
- `directory-structure`: Complete source code directory structure including src/, src/commands/, src/lib/ with all subdirectories (roadmap/, handoff/, helper/, orchestrator/, execution/, quality/, firewall/, gates/, lessons/, entropy/, completion/, clarification/, observability/, planning/, config/, metrics/), plus tests/, templates/, commands/, docs/, and examples/ directories
- `linting-formatting`: ESLint configuration for TypeScript code quality and Prettier configuration for consistent code formatting
- `template-files`: Template files for ROADMAP.md, HANDOFF.md, and forge.config.json to bootstrap new projects

### Modified Capabilities

None - this is initial project setup

## Impact

**Files Created:**
- `package.json` - Project manifest with dependencies and scripts
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configuration
- `vitest.config.ts` - Vitest testing framework configuration
- `.eslintrc.js` - ESLint linting rules
- `.prettierrc` - Prettier formatting rules
- `tests/setup.test.ts` - Sample test to verify testing infrastructure
- `templates/ROADMAP.template.md` - Template for ROADMAP files
- `templates/HANDOFF.template.md` - Template for HANDOFF files
- `templates/forge.config.template.json` - Template for configuration files

**Directories Created:**
- `src/` and all subdirectories per ROADMAP.md structure
- `tests/` for test files
- `templates/` for template files
- `commands/` for OpenCode command definitions
- `docs/` for documentation
- `examples/` for example projects

**Dependencies Added:**
- TypeScript (dev dependency)
- Vitest (dev dependency)
- Zod (runtime dependency)
- commander (runtime dependency)
- ESLint and related plugins (dev dependencies)
- Prettier (dev dependency)

**Parallel Execution:**
Tasks 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.5 can be executed in parallel as they have no dependencies. Task 0.3 requires 0.1, and Task 0.6 requires 0.4.
